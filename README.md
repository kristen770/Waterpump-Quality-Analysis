# Project Overview
This project analyzes a sample set of water pump preformance. Data analysis demonstrates clear actionable areas to increase revenue and a model slide deck prepared for a hypothetical first meeting with clients reviews the current state of water pump preformance, revenue flow and details an action plan for partnership. This project also includes a piece overviewing the importance of data in the water industry. 

# Business Problem
A water company has asked for consultation and imput on how to best maintain, maximize lifetime value and develop predicitve capabilities for their current infastructure. This analysis and slide deck were done under the assumption that this is the first meeting between teams. 

# Data  
Data is a sampling of waterpumps included in the primary dataset is information on each meter's test year, installation year, size, make and most recent accuracy reading.

# Methods  
Descriptive statistics, data filtering, data visualization, revenue modeling. 

# Results  
* More than 2/3 of the total 1,960 units analyzed were 'Neptune' model pumps  
* 90% of the units were 5/8" in size 
* Age distribution of models shoed the majority of models were less than 30 years old
